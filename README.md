I work at OpenIDEO, an online Open Innovation platform experimenting with how to open source social impact. We spend a lot of time thinking about how to strengthen ideas. The reason we do this is because good ideas are only a fraction of the battle, execution is much harder, but the stronger the idea the easier the execution. In our process we believe that there's value in spending time exploring the question & finding inspiration in unlikely places. We structure our process with these beliefs. We even offer collaboration points to encourage the sharing of ideas & information in our challenge topics. Yet we don't yet make this process seamless because we just started. Part of what I think about is how to improve the process.
